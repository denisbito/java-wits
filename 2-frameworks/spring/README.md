# Spring
The [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/) was started in 2003 to facilitate the creation of Java applications, in response to the complexity of the early J2EE specifications. It started with an emphasis on dependency injection and managing the collection of business objects - services, DAOs, etc. - inside an application.

Today, Spring has evolved to a whole family of modules and APIs, which help create web applications (Spring MVC), access data stored in databases (Spring Data), create RESTful web services and work with Microservices, among many others.
